## Full film — paste into Higgsfield storyboard mode (6 shots × 15 s ≈ 90 s)

Each `SHOT` below is one 15-second generation. Keep the STYLE and ACCENT paragraphs
at the top of **every** shot's prompt. In storyboard / long-video mode, let
Higgsfield carry continuity between shots; when generating shots one at a time,
feed each shot's **last frame** as the next shot's **first frame**.

```
STYLE — OhhO (identical for every film, do not change):
Photorealistic live-action cinematography — a premium robotics brand film shot like an Apple product documentary. Real physical robots and real hardware in a modern robotics lab / light-industrial space: polished concrete floor, dark matte walls, aluminum-extrusion workbenches, neat cable runs, tool walls, server racks and large monitors. All light comes from practical sources inside the space: one cool white key light, cyan LED strip accents (hex #00D4FF) and deep violet ambient fill (hex #7C3AED), with thin atmospheric haze catching the beams. Cinema-camera look: full-frame sensor, 35mm and 50mm prime lenses, shallow depth of field, filmic highlight roll-off, subtle natural film grain. The camera moves only on a motorized slider, gimbal or jib — one slow deliberate move per shot, no shake. Materials must read as physically real: brushed aluminum, anodized black metal, rubber wheels, braided cables, glass screens with true reflections and fingerprint-level detail. Every monitor or tablet in frame shows only a soft, out-of-focus dark dashboard — never readable text. Mood: calm, confident, precise, quietly futuristic. Color grade: cool and high-contrast, near-black shadows with neon cyan and violet practicals, never oversaturated.
NEGATIVE: no CGI look, no 3-D render or motion-graphics aesthetic, no floating holograms, no wireframes, no cartoon or anime, no recognizable human faces (hands, silhouettes and out-of-focus figures are allowed), no readable on-screen or printed text, no company logos or watermarks, no warm sunny tones, no oversaturation, no cuts inside a shot, no shaky handheld camera, no heavy lens flares.

PRIMARY ACCENT for this film: violet (hex #7C3AED) — the dominant practical lighting in every shot is violet (bench strips, status rings, screen spill); cyan (hex #00D4FF) appears only as a faint ambient fill deep in the background.

SHOT 1/6 — 15 s — First light: A dark warehouse aisle. The robot creeps forward, its depth camera painting faint structured light into the haze ahead of it. The camera tracks behind at wheel height, violet practicals striping the racking.

SHOT 2/6 — 15 s — Mapping: The robot glides through rooms and doorways, sensor sweeping steadily; on a cart nearby, a defocused monitor shows a floor plan growing stroke by stroke. Slow focus trades between machine and map-glow.

SHOT 3/6 — 15 s — The ask: A hand taps once on a tablet, its screen a soft blur. The robot pivots decisively toward a far doorway and sets off — instruction becoming motion. Slow push-in on the departing robot.

SHOT 4/6 — 15 s — Flow: A low tracking shot alongside: the robot glides confidently down an aisle, arcs cleanly around a pallet without slowing, and re-centers its line — navigation with intent.

SHOT 5/6 — 15 s — Re-plan: Wide. A cart is pushed into the robot's path mid-run. It eases off, carves a smooth new arc around the obstacle without stopping, and rejoins its route as if nothing happened.

SHOT 6/6 — 15 s — Hero: The robot rolls onto its goal marker and settles to a stop, violet ring steady, the mapped space stretching behind it. A slow fifteen-degree orbit. Upper third clean dark negative space for a title. Hold.
```

## Single-clip fallback — one 15 s generation

For a quick single-clip version (or models capped below 15 s), paste the STYLE and
ACCENT paragraphs above, then this condensed scene:

```
SCENE — OhhO Autonomy (one continuous 15 s shot): A robot creeps down a dark warehouse aisle painting structured light into the haze while a defocused floor plan grows on a cart monitor; one tap on a tablet sends it flowing through aisles, carving smoothly around a pushed-in cart, until it settles on its goal marker in a slow orbit with clean negative space up top.
```

## Going longer (unlimited plan)

- **15 s is the per-shot ceiling** on Higgsfield's top video models — length comes
  from *sequencing shots*, not from one long generation. The 6-shot film above
  is the baseline ≈90 s cut.
- Every shot ends on a deliberate hold, so Higgsfield's **AI Video Extender** can
  stretch any shot past 15 s (or loop the hero shot indefinitely) without a visible seam.
- To add beats, duplicate a mid-film shot, change only the action sentence, and
  chain it via last-frame → first-frame. The STYLE block keeps it in the family.
- On Veo 3.1, use **scene extension** from the hero shot for arbitrarily long
  ambient loops of the end frame.

## Text to add in post (don't let the model render it)

- **Wordmark:** `OhhO` (first & last O cyan `#00D4FF`, middle `hh` white)
- **Product name:** OhhO Autonomy · **Tagline:** Map it, navigate it, command it in plain language.
- **CTA:** `Open mission control →` · end on `The Open Robotics Platform`

## Platform cheat

Higgsfield → Create → Video → storyboard / long-video mode. Model: Seedance 2.0
(or your plan's unlimited model). 16:9 · 1080p · 15 s per shot. Reuse the OhhO
photoreal keyframe still as the first frame of SHOT 1; keep one fixed seed across
all films where the model exposes it.
